# Moira

Moira is an experimental project aimed at teaching computers to create music in
a manner akin to how one would instruct a music student. Unlike conventional
music generators that rely solely on AI-generated randomness, Moira emphasizes
the incorporation of fundamental music theory principles into the music
generation process.

### Motivation

Traditional music generation techniques often overlook the principles of music
theory, resulting in compositions that lack coherence and structure. With Moira,
we seek to bridge this gap by introducing basic music theory concepts and the
compositional process to computer-generated music. By treating elements such as
basslines, chords, and melodies as distinct entities rather than amalgamating
them, Moira aims to produce compositions that are not only algorithmically
generated but also musically informed.

### Key Features

- Educational Approach: Moira employs an instructional framework inspired by
  traditional music education methods, teaching computers the fundamentals of
  music theory and composition.
- Modular Composition: Unlike conventional music generators that generate entire
  compositions in one go, Moira breaks down the compositional process into
  separate components such as basslines, chords, and melodies. This modular
  approach allows for greater flexibility and control over the generated music.
- Music Theory Integration: Moira integrates essential concepts from music
  theory, including harmony, rhythm, and melody, into the music generation
  process. By adhering to established musical principles, Moira strives to
  produce compositions that resonate with human listeners.

### Usage

To use Moira, simply [insert instructions for installation and usage here].

### Future Developments

- Advanced Music Theory: Expand Moira's repertoire of music theory concepts to
  enable more sophisticated compositions, such as modal interchange and
  chromatic harmony.
- Interactive Learning: Introduce interactive learning features that allow users
  to engage directly with Moira and provide feedback on generated compositions.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize Moira's algorithms for efficiency and
  scalability, enabling real-time music generation and performance in diverse
  computing environments.
